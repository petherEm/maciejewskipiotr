## About Next.js 13 App Router

Next.js is well known for its file system-based routing, however, through its app directory, Next.js 13 has changed the manner in which many tasks were previously performed.

While still supporting the same file **system-based routing**, which uses the pages directory, the new app directory introduces the concepts of layouts, error components, and loading components while also **leveraging React server components** for building the UI. This has certain implications on traditional **Google Analytics script** implementation.

## GETTING READY

As the prerequisite, you should have a Next.js 13 app with the app directory structure and then install the 'client-only' package.

```c
npm install client-only
```

If you are using TypeScript, you should also install the types for the package.

```c

npm install @types/gtag.js --save-dev

```

## SETUP GOOGLE ANALYTICS

You will need to create a Google Analytics account and then create a **new property** for your Next.js app. Once you have created the property, you will be provided with a **tracking ID** that you will need to add to your app.

## CREATE A GOOGLE ANALYTICS COMPONENT AND A HELPER FUNCTION

You will need to build a Google Analytics component which will store the basic **gtag.js** code interacting with Google Analytics.

Do not forget to use "use client" marker to enable client-side code execution.

```c

// @/components/GoogleAnalytics.js

"use client";

import Script from "next/script";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import { pageview } from "@/lib/gtagHelper";

export default function GoogleAnalytics({ GA_MEASUREMENT_ID }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    const url = pathname + searchParams.toString();
    pageview(GA_MEASUREMENT_ID, url);
  }, [pathname, searchParams, GA_MEASUREMENT_ID]);

  return (
    <>
      <Script
        strategy="afterInteractive"
        src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}`}
      />
      <Script
        id="google-analytics"
        strategy="afterInteractive"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `
                window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
                function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
                gtag('js', new Date());

                gtag('consent', 'default', {
                    'analytics_storage': 'granted'
                });

                gtag('config', '${GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}', {
                    page_path: window.location.pathname,
                });
                `,
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}


```

Now have a look on the helper function that will be used to send the pageview event to Google Analytics.

```c

// lib/gtagHelper.js
export const pageview = (GA_MEASUREMENT_ID, url) => {
  window.gtag("config", GA_MEASUREMENT_ID, {
    page_path: url,
  });
};


```

## INJECT GOOGLE ANALYTICS COMPONENT INTO THE APP LAYOUT

Now you can inject the Google Analytics component into the app layout.

```c

import "./globals.css";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import NavBar from "@/components/Navbar";
import GoogleAnalytics from "@/components/GoogleAnalytics";


const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Analytics testing",
  description: "Analytics testing",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" data-theme="dark">
      <GoogleAnalytics GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-J46EGV9SRV" />
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <NavBar />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```
