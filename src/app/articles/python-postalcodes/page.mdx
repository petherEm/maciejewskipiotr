In some projects, you may need to retrieve geo coordinates from the set of zip codes. _`pgeocode`_ is a lightweight Python library for high-performance off-line querying of GPS coordinates, region name and municipality name from postal codes.

You can read this on **Medium** [here](https://medium.com/@pether.maciejewski/python-with-pgeocode-and-pandas-postal-codes-to-geo-coordinates-f75af689cc56).

Distances between postal codes and general distance queries are also supported. The database in use includes postal codes for **83 countries**.

Check the source [here](https://pypi.org/project/pgeocode/).

Let me quickly show you how to use _`pgeocode`_ in one of the real projects where we are tasked to retrieve geo coordinates from the subset of zip codes.

1. Let's begin with installing _`pgeocode`_.

```python

pip install pgeocode
or
conda install -c conda-forge pgeocode
```

2. Then, we import the key libraries for this little project.

```python
  import pandas as pd
  import os
  import pgeocode
```

3. And we import our data to pandas DataFrame to _`df`_ variable

```python
  df = pd.read_excel('CH_Post.xlsx')
  df
```

<Image src={Image_2} width={800} height={400} alt="" />

4. We are then storing zip codes column to _`postal_codes`_ variable

```python
  postal_codes = df["PLZ"].values.astype('str').tolist()
  postal_codes
```

5. Subsequently, we initiate our pgeocode library, indicating we are seeking coordinates from the zip codes in Switzerland (providing ISO country code)

```python
  nomi = pgeocode.Nominatim('ch')
  swiss_post = nomi.query_postal_code(postal_codes)
  swiss_post
```

<Image src={Image_4} width={800} height={400} alt="" />

6. The last step is to save our newly created dataset to _.csv_ file.

```python
  swiss_post.to_csv('CH_Post_with_geocoord.csv')
```

## CONCLUSION

In the six easy steps, you retrieved geo coordinates from the set of zip codes using pandas and pgeocode.
